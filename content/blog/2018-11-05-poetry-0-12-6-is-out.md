Bugfix release.

## Changes

- Poetry will now try to read, without executing, setup files (`setup.py` and/or `setup.cfg`) if the `egg_info` command fails when resolving dependencies.

## Fixes

- Fixed installation of directory dependencies.
- Fixed handling of dependencies with a `not in` marker operator.
- Fixed support for VCS dependencies.
- Fixed the `exclude` property not being respected if no VCS was available.
