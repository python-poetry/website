The Poetry team is pleased to announce the immediate availability of Poetry 1.0.1.

<!--more-->

This release is a bugfix release.

If you have a previous version of Poetry installed via the [official installer](/docs/#installation),
getting Poetry 1.0.1 is as easy as:

```bash
$ poetry self update
```
