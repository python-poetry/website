This version brings some improvements and a bunch of bugfixes.

## Changes

### Hashes check when installing

Whenever you install packages with poetry, they will be verified against the hashes
present in the `pyproject.lock` file to increase security.

## Fixes

- Fixed handling of post releases.
- Fixed python restricted dependencies not being checked against virtualenv version.
- Fixed python/platform constraint not being picked up for subdependencies.
- Fixed skipped packages appearing as installing.
- Fixed platform specification not being used when resolving dependencies.
