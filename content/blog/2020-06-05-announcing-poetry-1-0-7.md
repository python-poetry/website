The Poetry team is pleased to announce the immediate availability of Poetry 1.0.7.

This release is a bugfix release.

If you have a previous version of Poetry installed via the [official installer](/docs/#installation),
getting Poetry 1.0.7 is as easy as:

```bash
$ poetry self update
```

### Fixes

- Fixed an error when trying to execute some packages `setup.py` file ([#2349](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/2349)).
