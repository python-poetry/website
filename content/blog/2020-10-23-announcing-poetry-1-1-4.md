The Poetry team is pleased to announce the immediate availability of Poetry 1.1.4.

<!--more-->

This release is a bugfix release.

If you have a previous version of Poetry installed via the [official installer](/docs/#installation),
getting Poetry 1.1.4 is as easy as:

```bash
$ poetry self update
```

### Features

- Added `installer.parallel` boolean flag (defaults to `true`) configuration to enable/disable parallel execution of operations when using the new installer. ([#3088](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/3088))

### Changes

- When using system environments as an unprivileged user, user site and bin directories are created if they do not already exist. ([#3107](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/3107))

### Fixes

- Fixed editable installation of poetry projects when using system environments. ([#3107](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/3107))
- Fixed locking of nested extra activations. If you were affected by this issue, you will need to regenerate the lock file using `poetry lock --no-update`. ([#3229](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/3229))
- Fixed prioritisation of non-default custom package sources. ([#3251](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/3251))
- Fixed detection of installed editable packages when non-poetry managed `.pth` file exists. ([#3210](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/3210))
- Fixed scripts generated by editable builder to use valid import statements. ([#3214](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/3214))
- Fixed recursion error when locked dependencies contain cyclic dependencies. ([#3237](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/3237))
- Fixed propagation of editable flag for VCS dependencies. ([#3264](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/3264))
